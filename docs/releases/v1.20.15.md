## New package: Welcome containerd ansible role! 📕

This release adds the `containerd` ansible role to prepare the path for the docker removal in Kubernetes version 1.24.

## Update Guide 🦮

In this guide, we will try to summarize the update process for these release.

> NOTE: Each on-premise environment can be different, always double-check before updating components.

## dex

To update dex package, please run the following command:

```yaml
kustomize build <your-project-path-including-dex-as-base> | kubectl apply -f -
```

## vsphere-cm

The vSphere controller manager update can be executed before upgrading the cluster version to v1.20.x. 
The current versions is compatible with Kubernetes 1.20.x and it's standard skew versions.

Due to some changes on the manifests, you need to change the patch on the secrets used by the vsphere controller manager:
- rename Secret `vsphere-credentials` to `vsphere-cloud-secret`
- rename Secret `cloud-config` to `vsphere-cloud-config`

Delete the daemonset `vsphere-cloud-controller-manager` (due to immutable fields):

```bash
kubectl delete ds vsphere-cloud-controller-manager -n kube-system
```

Once everything is done, please run the following command:

```yaml
kustomize build <your-project-path-including-vmware-cm-as-base> | kubectl apply -f -
```

## vsphere-csi

The vSphere CSI driver update is a little bit more complicated. In this versions the CSI driver DaemonSet and Deployment 
is moved to a dedicated namespace `vmware-system-csi`, and to address this we need to delete the current CSI driver from the cluster:

```yaml
kubectl delete -f katalog/vsphere-csi/vsphere-csi-controller-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f katalog/vsphere-csi/vsphere-csi-node-ds.yaml
kubectl delete -f katalog/vsphere-csi/vsphere-csi-controller-rbac.yaml
kubectl delete -f katalog/vsphere-csi/csi-vsphere-secret.yml
```

Now, download the new katalog package in your project, change patch applied to the `vsphere-config-secret` to the new namespace
and apply the new version:

```yaml
kustomize build <your-project-path-including-vmware-csi-as-base> | kubectl apply -f -
```
