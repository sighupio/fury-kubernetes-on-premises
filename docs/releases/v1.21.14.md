## New features 🚀

This release adds some new features to the ansible roles:

- Kubernetes' packages are now "held" on Debian systems and "locked" on RHEL/Rocky systems.
- All the package versions are managed with maps, the only parameter that needs to be configured is the `kubernetes_version` parameter.
- The removal of the swap in the `/etc/fstab` file is also managed in case of LVM based disks.
- New playbooks to run the upgrades on control plane and nodes automatically, see the `./examples/playbooks` for the example.
- Added variables on kubernetes roles to control the behavior of the upgrade process.
