## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

In this guide, we will try to summarize the update process from `v1.24.7` to this release.

> NOTE: Each on-premises environment can be different, always double-check before updating components.

1. Update the vSphere Controller Manager package and vSphere CSI if applicable (see below)
2. Update Kubernetes control plane nodes (see the [example playbooks](examples/playbooks))
3. Update workers (see the [example playbooks](examples/playbooks))
4. Update KFD if applicable (see the [KFD `1.25.x` release notes](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/tree/master/docs/releases))

## node-role.kubernetes.io/master: "" label and taint removal

In the previous Kubernetes version, the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""` was removed from the control plane (master) nodes and replaced by `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""`. Taints `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` and `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule` were still present.

In this version, the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule` taint has been removed.
