# HAproxy

This Ansible role installs and configures HAproxy on a machine.

This role also supports having >1 `haproxy` in a failover scheme using a shared virtual IP with `keepalived` and VRRP.

| `keepalived_ip`                | The virtual IP that will be used as VRRP address. Ex. `10.2.0.10/16`                                                           | -             |

| `keepalived_virtual_router_id` | VRRP virtual router ID. Must be different for every keepalived cluster.                                                        | `51`          |
| `keepalived_on_k8s_master`     | Set to `true` if keepalived is running on a Kubernets master to enable specific checks.                                        | `false`       |
| `control_plane_endpoint`       | Kubernetes control plane endpoint. Generally set as part of Kubernetes roles. Needed when `keepalived_on_k8s_master` is `true` | -             |

> ⚠️ Please notice that the role will assume that if the machine hostname ends with `-1`, the machine will be configured as a keepalived `MASTER` and will have the highest weight.
